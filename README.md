# nginx-wordpress
NGINX config to: Wordpress, Fastcgi, SSL from LetsEncypt, HTTPS, PageSpeed and PhpMyadmin.

This files are not (yet) well organized and clean, but maybe can help who are looking NGINX configuration to work with Wordpress (with rules and blocks for plugins woocomerce, Nginx Helper, Redis Object Cache), SSL, HTTPS (in some parts of the website only), Fastcgi with module ngx_cache_purge and google Pagespeed module.
